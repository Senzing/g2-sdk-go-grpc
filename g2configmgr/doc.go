/*
The g2configmgr package is used to modify Senzing configurations in the Senzing database.
It is a wrapper over Senzing's G2Configmgr C binding.

To use g2configmgr,
the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable must include a path to Senzing's libraries.
Example:

	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/senzing/g2/lib
*/
package g2configmgr
