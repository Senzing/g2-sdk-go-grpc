/*
The g2engine package is used to add, modify, delete, and query records/entities in the Senzing engine.
It is a wrapper over Senzing's G2 C binding.

To use g2engine,
the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable must include a path to Senzing's libraries.
Example:

	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/senzing/g2/lib
*/
package g2engine
