/*
The g2diagnostic package is used to inspect the Senzing environment.
It is a wrapper over Senzing's G2Diagnostic C binding.

To use g2diagnostic,
the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable must include a path to Senzing's libraries.
Example:

	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/senzing/g2/lib
*/
package g2diagnostic
